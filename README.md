# TimeLog
Manages data storage and formatting of detailed descriptions of monthly, and yearly work for independent contractors.

Allows the user to input their work on a multitude of tasks on a particular day, for individual clients. They can add and remove both clients, and categories of tasks as they please. Entries can be edited and removed after they are submitted.

Data for all entries is saved in a file, so that when the software is run later, the user does not have to re-enter everything

Three different types of reports can be generated, a monthly breakdown by client, a monthly breakdown by date, and a yearly breakdown containing pay in each month, pay rate may also be adjusted and saved by the user.
